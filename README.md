The 'All-cause mortality.csv' dataset originally comes from the open access article "Menopausal hormone therapy and womenâ€™s health: An umbrella review" https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003731.

To illustrate using Goodtables to validate the dataset, three types of errors were manually introduced, including blank header name, duplicate rows, and missing value. Please refer to the Goodtables blog for more informaiton.
