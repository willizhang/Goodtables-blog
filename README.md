The "All-Cause Mortality.csv" dataset originally comes from the open access article ["Menopausal hormone therapy and womenâ€™s health: An umbrella review"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003731). In order to illustrate how to use [Goodtables tool](https://try.goodtables.io) to validate tabular data, three types of errors were manually introduced, including missing value, duplicate rows, and format error. Please refer to the [Goodtables blog](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/blog/guo-qiang-goodtables-blog/) for more informaiton.
